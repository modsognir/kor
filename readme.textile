h2. Usage

Kor uses a global configuration file at _~/.kor_. All keys and server names should be stored in this file, in yaml format.

<pre>
ssh_user: admin
keys:
  some_guy: ssh-rsa afAT3z+aladhdjVq0HtWtjurjCFe== modsognir@modsognir.com
  some_other_guy: ssh-rsa Eaa3z+ala6ns9VdgsgsgsgHtWwkCFe== not_modsognir@modsognir.com
servers:
  modsognir: 192.168.0.1
  google: 66.102.11.104
</pre>

Once that is setup, then you can use thor to add keys to servers. NOTE: You must already have ssh access to these servers.

@thor keys:add some_guy modsognir@
@thor keys:add some_other_guy google@


h2. Installation
